# Video Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a video recommendation system that provides personalized video suggestions to users based on their preferences, popular trends, and recent uploads. The system generates short video previews, selects the most engaging thumbnail, and creates relevant captions to enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Video Dataset**: A collection of videos stored in a dataset (N video dataset).
- **Video Selection**: Filtering videos based on user preferences, trending/hit videos, and the latest uploads to create a refined selection (M video set).
- **Re-Ranking with LTR (Learning to Rank)**: Prioritizing the selected videos using an LTR algorithm to generate the top 10 recommendations.
- **Content Generation**:
  - Captions for each recommended video.
  - Short, engaging previews.
  - Thumbnails customized to user preferences.
- **User Authentication**: Users log in to receive personalized recommendations.

## Workflow
1. **User Logs In**: The system retrieves user data and preferences.
2. **Video Selection**:
   - Filters the video dataset to find the most relevant content.
   - Considers user watch history, trending videos, and the latest uploads.
3. **Re-Ranking (LTR)**:
   - Applies Learning to Rank techniques to prioritize the best recommendations.
   - Selects the top 10 videos for the user.
4. **Content Enhancement**:
   - Generates short preview clips highlighting key moments.
   - Selects the most engaging thumbnail for each video.
   - Creates captions relevant to the userâ€™s interests.
5. **Recommendation Display**: The top 10 recommended videos, along with enhanced content, are presented to the user.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Learning to Rank (LTR) for optimizing recommendations.
- **Computer Vision**: Thumbnail and short video preview generation.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Caption generation.
- **Data Processing**: User preference analysis and video metadata processing.
